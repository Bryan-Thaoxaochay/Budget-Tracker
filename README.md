## What I Learned

### List
1. Progressive Web Apps

Using webpack, I was able to give the app the ability to work offline. Along with that, cache API and service workers came in handy as well.

2. Minification

Using the JSCompress website, I was able to decrease some JS files into the minimum amount of code required.

3. IndexedDB

I was able to create an indexedDB database that would store API requests when the app was offline. Then, the data would be sent to a MongoDB database once back online.
